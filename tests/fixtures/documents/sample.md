# Introduction to RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines retrieval with generation.

## Key Components

### Vector Database

The vector database stores embeddings of document chunks.
It enables semantic search over large document collections.

### Embedding Model

Embeddings convert text into dense vectors.
These vectors capture semantic meaning.

### LLM

The language model generates responses based on retrieved context.

## Benefits

RAG provides several advantages:
- Reduces hallucinations
- Enables knowledge grounding
- Allows dynamic knowledge updates

## Challenges

Some challenges include:
- Chunk size optimization
- Relevance ranking
- Context window limitations

# Conclusion

RAG is a powerful technique for building knowledge-grounded applications.
