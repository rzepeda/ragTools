Python Programming Basics
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.
Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
Common uses include web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing.
Key features:
- Easy to learn and read
- Dynamic typing
- Automatic memory management (garbage collection)
- Extensive standard library
- Support for multiple programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional)
