Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.
Recently, artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.
Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories:
1. Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.
2. Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input.
3. Reinforcement learning: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent).
