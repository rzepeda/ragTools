Understanding Embeddings
In natural language processing (NLP), word embedding is a term used for the representation of words for text analysis, typically in the form of a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word such that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning.
Embeddings can be obtained using a set of language modeling and feature learning techniques where terms from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.
Conceptually, it involves a mathematical embedding from a space with many dimensions per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower dimension.
Common methods for generating word embeddings include:
- Word2Vec
- GloVe
- FastText
- Transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.)
Embeddings are crucial for semantic search, as they allow comparing the meaning of text rather than just keyword matching.
